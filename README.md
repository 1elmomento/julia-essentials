# Julia Progrmming Language Essentials

A normie who already knows Python, decides to learn R. He tries it and doesn't like it, so one morning he decides to explore the world of Julia programming language.

Since I (the normie) am learning Julia I thought to myself it would be beneficial if I share my notes with others. These notes are also published in [my personal blog](https://norme.breablog.dev) and you can see my other writings as well (but currently I have only three blog post, but hopefully in future the list be large). 

## Structure of folders
Each subject have following structure: There is a `Main.jl` file in each folder companied with a `README.md` file. Inside of the `Main.jl` file we will see example codes of Julia programming language with comments explaining the code. In the `README.md` file, there is a full description written for that subject that delve more deeper to the subject. 

I often compare languages with each other to see the difference. This is why I compare Julia with programming languags like Python, C, or Java. This helps when you have a familiarity with these languages and helps to understand subjects more easily. However, if you are new to the amazing world of programming, you can also use the notes. In this case the comparison might broaden you view on programming, so don't panic and just learn.
